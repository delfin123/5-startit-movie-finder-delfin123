To make sure everything works in this initial repo:
- clone
- do `npm install` in root of this repo
- do `npm run test` for run Homatask 5
- do `npm run test-H/t3` for run Hometask 3
- do `npm run test-travis` for run Hometask 5 using Travis CI
- do `npm run test-cucumber` for running tests which use cucumber
- do `npm run test-mocha` for running test which use mocha

- you should see chrome browser blinking, and something like this in console:
```
